  "content": "**All children have the right to a safe and loving environment. Every child has the right to survive, to thrive, to belong, to be heard, to receive adequate care and to grow up in a protective environment.**\r\n\r\n**A family is the first line of creating a safe and loving environment for children.** Parents or other caregivers have the primary responsibility for building a protective and loving home. Schools and communities are responsible for building a safe and child-friendly environment outside the child\u2019s home.\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately, millions of children are not fully protected.** Many children deal with violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, exclusion and/or discrimination every day. These kinds of violations limit their chances of surviving, thriving and pursuing their dreams.\r\n\r\n**No children may work except when they have reached the legal age permitted by all state and local laws, and none may be forced to work without the consent of their parents.  Children may not be exploited or trafficked in any way.\r\n\r\n**What is protection?**\r\n\r\nGirls and boys should be encouraged and supported to speak up for children\u2019s rights.  Young people should take an active role in their own protection against abuse, violence, exploitation and discrimination.\r\n\r\n1.\t**Every child should have the opportunity to grow up in a family.** If a family is unable to care for the child, steps should be taken by community authorities to address the reasons and make every effort to keep the family together.\r\n\r\n2.\t**Every child has a right to a legally registered birth and name.** Registering a child\u2019s birth is required by state law to ensure a child\u2019s right to education, healthcare, and legal and social services.\r\n\r\n3.\t**Girls and boys must be protected from all forms of violence and abuse.** Violence includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse, neglect and harmful practices. Families, communities and authorities must take responsibility for this protection.\r\n\r\n4.\t**Children must be protected from any work that is hazardous.** Work should not prevent them from attending school.\r\n\r\n5.\t**Girls and boys can risk sexual abuse and exploitation** in their home, school, workplace or community. Measures must be taken to prevent sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexually abused and exploited children need immediate help to stop such abuse.\r\n\r\n6.\t**Children become vulnerable to trafficking if child protection is weak or missing.**  State and local authorities, the community and families are responsible to prevent or stop trafficking.  They are also responsible to help children who have been victimized reintegrate into their families and communities, if it is in their best interest.\r\n\r\n7.\t**Justice for children should be based on child rights.** Jailing or institutionalizing children must always be a last resort. Child-centric procedures should be set up for children who are victims or witnesses of crime.\r\n\r\n8.\t**Income support and social welfare services can help** keep families together and children in school and ensure access to healthcare.\r\n\r\n9.\t**All children have a right to age-appropriate information**, to be heard and to participate in making decisions that concern them. Fulfilment of this right enables children to take an active role in their own protection against abuse, violence and exploitation, and to become active citizens.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
